## 🧠 Architecture Overview

The application follows a layered structure:

* **Models** → Data representation
* **Providers** → Business logic & state management
* **Screens** → UI pages
* **Widgets** → Reusable UI components

State management is handled using Provider, separating UI from logic and ensuring maintainability and scalability.
